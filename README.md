# Volleyball-Project

## In Progress

**A project to determine whether height is an impactful trait for professional Volleyball Players.**

Data is collected by scraping the public wikipedia pages of players to obtain their Height, Position, Spike and Block (reach). Data is also scraped from official FIVB tables that 
display the points vs attempts of each player. A hypothesis test is used to determine whether taller players are statistically probable to have (potentially) higher scoring ratio's
than the average player.


Notes:
The data is also there to calculate the vertical jumps of each player. This could allow for a representation of skill vs genetic/physicality in Volleyball.
However, other aspects come into play such as the biomechanics of the human body e.g. taller players will have a lower vertical jump than shorter players but will be faster in
reaching their max point.
